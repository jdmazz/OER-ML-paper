# Project Title: OER-ML-paper

This project uses machine learning (ML) to explore the relationships between quaternary alloy composition, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), and the Tafel equations as a function of overpotential. This dataset was generated using a custom high-throughput Single Droplet Cell (HT-SDC) with 0.5 mL 0.1 M H2SO4 electrolyte solution. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) data for various alloy compositions of {Ir,Pt,Au,Pd} are recorded in the CV folder, but only the 5th forward cycle is used for analysis.
